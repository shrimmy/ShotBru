ShotBru - (Photo Helper)
Play on South African slang, shot meaning thanks, and bru meaning friend. The intent of this device is to sense some form of input (sound, light, movement, etc) and trigger the camera or a flash.

Components
- Netduino
- LCD Display (2 x 16)
- 6 Push Buttons
- 2 Sensor Jacks
- 2 Camera Jacks
- Assorted Electronic components (will post schematics when I complete them)

This is just a first cut to get something out there. More updates to come...
